**Cloud Expert** & **Public Speaker** based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Moving to the cloud is a critical process that requires lots of preparation. Without the proper
strategy, your project is most likely to fail.  
From the technical challenges to the cultural
aspects of these transformations, I help small, medium and large organisations to create a solid plan
and execute it smoothly, guaranteeing the success of your transition to the cloud!

My broad experience in programmable infrastructure and distributed computing technologies can help
your company increase the utilisation of both your human and computing resources, creating greater
margings in your profit as well as boosting your team's overall happiness level.

From research to development to integration I have had the opportunity to work in the past with multiple
public cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Packet, DigitalOcean among others, and serious hands-on
experience with the following stacks:

#### Container technologies

  - Docker
  - rkt

#### Orchestration

  - Docker Swarm
  - Mesos (DC/OS)
  - Kubernetes (both in the cloud as well as On-Premise)
  - Nomad

#### Configuration Management tools
  - Ansible
  - Puppet
  - Capistrano

I also have plenty of experience with the HashiStack (Nomad, Vault, Packer) and specially with Terraform
for which I have developed a couple of custom providers.

I work as an indepentent consultant focusing on programmable infrastructure and cultural transformations.
I use my expertise in software development, as well as leadership,
strategy and operations to help my customers innovate at speed and scale.  
I'm based in The Netherlands, covering all the EMEA region and for the right project I am willing to travel
to the United States regularly.
