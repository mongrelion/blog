> **TLDR: Buy a Stainless Steel karabiner with a strain rate of at least 2.5kN**

When was the last time that you changed your karabiner? And why did you change it?
Is it because it's been two years? is it because you dropped it and you're not sure
anymore about the integrity of the device?
How long as it been since the last time you changed your karabiner?
How about the one that attaches the rescue to the harness? When was the last time
that you inspected that one for marks of wear? How old is that karabiner?

# When things go almost wrong

Take a look at [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZFh-bcCfwQ) flying with
an open karabiner throughout his whole 1h50m flight. The pilot mentions in the
comments the following:

> It's a kortel mylon, it wasn't fixed properly (my fault), and probably opened
> at start. It was almost a 2 hours long flight (towed start): And I didn't notice
> it's open until landed! I was lucky.

This pilot is both very lucky to have survived this incident and very brave to
post the video online because although the intention is to raise awareness within
the free flight community, he also knows that there will be haters calling him
stupid, that he should quit the sport, etc.

Thank you Andras for sharing this important lesson with all of us.

# How often people change their karabiners?
[This thread](http://forum.hanggliding.org/viewtopic.php?t=35276) on the
Hang Gliding Forums asked that question and even though the amount of participants
was underwhelming (57 in total), a total of 44 people said that they never change
their karabiners!

# Passive Safety
Whatever your gear has to offer that requires zero input from your during
a flight is what we call passive safety.
The keel strap on your helmet, the risers on your paraglider, your wires on
your hang glider, etc., are a few examples of Passive Safety features.

Your karabiner, which requires zero input from you once you're airborn, is also
considered a Passive Safety device or feature.

Some of these devices will have so little strain that you will almost never have
to replace them. For example, the clip on the chin strap of your helmet is under
so little strain that you probably have never thought of changing it. And that's
probably fine. But your karabiner, though...

# The karabiner under load
I weight somewhere between 70-73Kg. My hook-in weight is somewhere near 85Kg
counting clothes, helmet, harness, reserve, water, food, radio, vario, batteries
and what not. That means that whatever karabiner I use has to hold at least that much.
What I mean by this is that whatever karabiner I buy, when I hook into my glider
and hang from it, it shouldn't break.

The term used for knowing how much a karabiner can take before it breaks is called
**breaking strain** (although in Physics the correct term is [Ultimate tensile strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength)).
and is measured in Newtons. A karabiner that breaks under a load of 85Kg (my hook-in weight)
has a breaking strain of 0.85kN (kiloNewtons).

But taking off with such a small breaking strain rating is rather scary, taking into
consideration that most of our flying happens in turbulent conditions in which the
G loading can increase considerably, specially when you get slack lines! Suddenly
you have now 2 or 3 extra Gs added to your system, meaning that your karabiner
doesn't think that my weight is 85Kg anymore but 3 times that, 255Kg! whoops.

Reading on the Wills Wing website, a lot of the hang gliders out there are tested
up to 5G before they break, so ideally our karabiner is somewhere near those numbers
because I think it's safe to say that if the wing has broken I think the main karabiner
is the least of our concerns.

In a hypothetical scenario where I bring the load to 5G the stress put onto my
karabiner would be at around 425kN (my hook-in weight 85 times 5).

Here are a few breaking strains of the most common makers in the industry:

| Maker                | Model                      | Material        | Weight | Breaking Strain |
|----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| AustriAlpin          | Stratus [10]               | Aluminium       | 64g    | 18kN            |
| AustriAlpin          | Stratus Inox [11]          | Stainless Steel | 130g   | 28kN            |
| AustriAlpin          | Powerfly [12]              | Stainless Steel | 139g   | 26kN            |
| Finsterwalder-Charly | Snaplock [5]               | Titanal         | 76g    | 30kN            |
| Finsterwalder-Charly | Pin Lock [6]               | Titanal         | 80g    | 25kN            |
| Finsterwalder-Charly | Quickout [7]               | Titanal         | 200g   | 40kN            |
| Maillon-Rapide       | Square Quick Link [8]      | Stainless Steel | 64g    | 20kN            |
| Maillon-Rapide       | Trapezoidal Quick Link [9] | Stainless Steel | 129g   | 49kN            |
| SupAir               | Self-locking [2]           | Aluminium       | 68g    | 18kN            |
| SupAir               | Self-locking [3]           | Aluminium       | 72g    | 16kN            |
| SupAir               | Self-locking [4]           | Stainless Steel | 130g   | 24kN            |
| Woody Valley         | Skyway [1]                 | Aluminium       | 48g    | 19kN            |

A quick word about the Maillon-Rapide karabiners: these are the most cost-effective
'biners that I can see but with the caveat that setting them up requires more
caution than with the rest of the self-locking mechanisms of other makers.

All of them offer a breaking strain rating well above my hook-in weight even at 5G.
What I can see though is that there are three materials in place: aluminium, stainless
steel and titanal, an alloy made of aluminium that promises better material
performance.

# Steel vs others
AndrÃ© van der Lingen, Mechanical Engineer, hang glider pilot and sail glider pilot
says:

> Steel is very predictable in fatigue.
> When the repetitive force does not exceed say 50% of the Ultimate Strength
> (breaking point) of the material, it doesn't matter how much cycles it is
> subjected to, it will never break. This limit is called the fatigue limit and
> is not influenced by numbers of cycles. Aluminium behaves way different and
> has a so called s/n curve. Aluminum could hold up to 70% of it's Ultima Strength
> at 10.000 cycles but might drop to only 30% at 1.000.000 cycles. There's no

Another important piece of information can be found on the [white paper written by
Dipl. Ing. Thomas Finsterwalder](https://finsterwalder-charly.de/en/risk-of-material-fatigue-in-air-sports-carabiners.html)
on _Risk of material fatigue in air sports carabiners with conventional snap gate_.

To summarize it, our inherent problem in free flying is that these karabiners are
normally made for static loading (imagine a climber just hanging from it) while
we are constantly adding dynamic loading to it because of the fly that we fly in.
This has a very critical impact on the overall performance of the material and
the breaking strain of the karabiner.

Asking a bunch of friends and reading on the hang gliding forums I found out that
the material that performs better under dynamic loading is Stainless Steel.
This is what I'm going to stick to 

# Tests
The reason why some karabiners are more expensive than others is because in order
to arrive to the final product, designers have to run stress tests to find out
the sweet spot between breaking strain, weight and costs.
As a designer if you run tests on a batch of a 1000 karabiners, that's a 1000
karabiners that you're "throwing away", plus the costs of renting the equipment
to run the actual tests, plus the man hours invested on analyzing the data, fixing
the issues in the design, making more karabiners, etc. The costs add up. These costs
are obviously passed on to the customer and that's why some karabiners are much
more expensive than others.

So next time that you see an aluminium karabiner with a breaking strain of 20kN
in Amazon selling for only US$10, think twice.

# Saftey Warnings
Good karabiners will come with a serial number imprinted on the material.
If customers from a specific batch of karabiners notice malfunctions or deformations
on a certain karabiner, it's their responsibility to report this to the factory.
If several people report the same problem to the factory the company will issue
a Safety Warning explaining the issue with the product. If the problem is only
present in a specific batch, the announcement will say so and the people that
bought a karabiner from that batch will be able to return the product and receive
a good one.
If the whole product has a design flaw that makes it ultimately too risky, the
factory will recall the whole line and issue a refund to each customer that bought
such a karabiner.

# Parting thoughts
Initially I just wanted to write down a comparison list of alu vs steel karabiners.
The more I pulled from the thread the more information I found, so I had to keep
the scope as short as I could without skipping vital information.

If you think that there is important information that is missing from this article
do not hesitate to drop me a line via social media and I'll be happy to amend the article.

Special thanks to my friends Fran Ruiz and Andre van der Lingen for their input.
