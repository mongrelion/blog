I finally started taking hang gliding lessons!

#### How it all started
Even though I would like to I can't really pinpoint a moment in time where I made a
decision to learn to fly. I remember, though, that on the early days I saw on the Discovery Kids
channel a program talking about people flying on balloons. I was impressed. I loved the
idea and like any other regular kid I would have loved to try it out. But for whatever reasons
it never happened. Fast forward several years. I'm in Colombia backpacking through the Eje Cafetero,
I make it to the [Nevado del Ruiz](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mongrelion/albums/72157628933574693)
and I meet a college teacher who practices paragliding. We talk a little bit about the sport and
prices for your own gear. I can't remember the exact number but I do remember thinking that I
could definitely save up all that and get started. My trip is now over and I'm already back
home in Barranquilla, in the north of Colombia, where the sport does not exist at all perhaps
because of the lack of (high enough) mountains to make it viable. The idea goes into stand-by mode.
I have been in touch with some group of nerds on IRC where we talk about random nerd stuff but
interestingly among the off-topic conversations sailgliding comes up. Somebody pratices the sport
and I think it's pretty cool. The whole free flight idea fancies me to no end. I want it but where
I live at seems just impossible. I look on Internet for some sailgliding schools in Colombia. Only two
of them pop up and they are all the way in Bogotá and it seems like you have to belong to the army or
something - w00t? The idea then again goes into stand-by mode.

A short year after this I leave Colombia in the look for a brighter future outside
of the land that once saw me running barefoot and seminaked on the dusty streets of my hometown. A city
called Grenoble in the south of France next to the Alps was in the itinerary of my Eurotrip and I look
on Internet again for a school or maybe just a club that can give me a tandem flight so that I can get
at least a bite of the sport. I find it. I go there. I do it. It's pure dope. I love it. I look on
Internet on how to get into the sport. I look for gear prices. I find out that a new glider (a not too
fancy one) starts from US$35.000. I laugh. I close the tab. I forget about it: there is no way in the
world that I will make 35 grand in the upcoming two years to start doing anything about it.

#### Looking for options
But I still wanted to fly. I had already had the experience of free flight and I loved it. I needed it. Hey, I'm
living in Europe now, the mountains are not as far anymore and my numbers are doing better than before,
so perhaps I can now look into some sort of free flight sport that is not as expensive. I remembered
the talk that I had with the college teacher a couple of years ago, the paragliding pilot. I look for
paragliding schools. They are all over the place but somehow going from sailgliding to paragliding feels
like a "downgrade". I thought about the other apparatus that looked like a kite, the one that was featured
in [Pilotwings 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilotwings_64)...  Hang gliding! Yeah, that should be fun!
I go off on a quest for getting started with the sport. I look for information all over the Internet: blogs,
forums, instructional videos on YouTube (there are not that many in there, by the way) and what not.
There are several hang gliding schools in Europe; none of them anywhere conveniently close to where I live
but I am willing to travel anywhere within bus/train distance. There are a couple but all of them are in Dutch
and so far my knowledge of the language is rather poor which makes things more difficult. Google Translate is
not that good with this language either. Some of the schools' websites that I find look like websites written
in the ages of geocities/tripod if you know what I mean so that somehow turns me off a little. I finally
find a school in the south of The Netherlands with a decently looking website. I get in touch with them,
I pay for the training and off I go to my first training session (after three months or so of waiting
because when I paid it was not yet flying season).

#### The first experience
Boy, what a disappointment. Not on the sport, no. On myself. We're talking about years of build up, years of
craving to finally get to fly on my own. Among the things that I read on Internet about the sport someone said
something like «if you can ride a bike you can hang glide». What they meant by that is that if you have the
psychomotor skills for performing such a task (bike riding) then you obviously have the psychomotor abilities
to develop hang gliding skills. But this is not what I understood. The way I interpreted that was
"hang gliding is as easy as riding a bike". When I got to that understanding I told myself
"hey, I can ride a bike!" and so the expectations went all the way to the ceiling.  Big mistake because I really
sucked at it. Hard. I came back home defeated and feeling down. I was afraid I didn't have what it took for it.
Well, what the hell, I already paid for this shit. I will go a second time and if I confirm that I just am not
made for hang gliding, well, then perhaps I can get a refund or something.  
It went awesome! I remembered all the lessons taught by my instructor on the previous session. It all made
sense and it all clicked. I remember there being some fellow pilots that were also on their early stages
of the learning process and they commented on my technique which they appreciated. I simply passed along
the very same advice that my instructor had given me. In no time I was already doing higher flights (ok,
not too high but still higher than the other students that were there with me). I made good friends that
day and [we really had a good time](https://goo.gl/photos/7k5iBnmXBzTgfsq39).
One of them even happened to be living two blocks away from where I live (remember that the school
is all the way to the south of The Netherlands) and gave me a ride all the way back home.
You can by now imagine how it all went after that: my motivation was back again up and I was already
looking forward to the next challenges that were to come with the progress of my training: going higher,
releasing the link, grabbing the speed bar, flying with a non-school harness, tucking my feet into the
harness, fly even higher, thermal, going higher on my own, cross country flights, going to fly to the
mountains with the school, going to fly to other places on my own (Colombia is a destination that is
indeed in the list along with Australia, Switzerland, France, Spain, all over the world, basically).
because, yeah, when you're just starting they don't tow you up as high, they don't encourage you to let
go the uprights to grab the control bar but instead just stay in that upright position for the whole flight

One important thing to mention is that because The Netherlands is such a flat land mountain
flying results impossible because (surprise, surprise) there are no mountains here! That's why we
do winch towing here, which is nothing but a really long metal line hooked to your harness and
pulled by a winch for a few hundred meters until you're really high up in the air. This method is
known as "winch towing" and its use is not only limited to hang gliding but also to paragliding,
sailgliding and perhaps some other free flight disciplines that I don't know of.  
Also, the sport is regulated, which means that in order for you to fly here you need to have a proper
license for such a purpose. There are three different levels/categories on which the hang gliding pilots into:
B1, B2 and B3 level. I'm going to briefly explain what it all means:
* B1: When you get this license (you actually don't get anything - it's just the school saying that you're at that level)
      it means that you already know how to rig up & down the wing, perform the necessary pre-flight security checks,
      put on your harness, hang yourself to the wing, do the hang check, hold properly the wing by keeping
      it straight (not tilt) and with the nose properly leveled, you are autonomous enough as for giving
      instruction to the winch assistant to start the towing process, take off properly making all the corrections
      that might be necessary for you to always keep your course and no funky unpredictable turnings or anything like that,
      you know how to properly release the towing line once you're in the air, you also know how to perform circuits in the
      air (that means that you know how to properly turn to the left, to the right, to face the wind again) and most
      importantly you know how to land, always facing the wind. When you are on this license you must always flight
      under the supervision of your instructor, not only for security reasons but also so that they can correct on
      early stages of your learning process bad habits that you might be growing and that you are not aware of.
* B2: On this level you are now flying with your own gear (radio, helmet, harness, wing, vario and others) and are
      working hard on perfectioning your flying technique, getting rid of vices, bad practices, flying prone, tucking
      your feet into the harness (which is not a school harness anymore) and perhaps even thermal flying but I'm not
      sure about that part yet. You must also pass a theoretical exam on which they assess your knowledge on weather
      prediction, cloud reading and other things that I am not yet aware of but that I will soon be. Also, once you get
      this license you can go to any winching club in The Netherlands and you can fly without the supervision of anybody.
      You become an independent, autonomous bird (which is what I am going for at the moment!).
* B3: This is for the experienced pilot that you like to do cross country flights in The Netherlands. For this you must
      have a clear understanding on all of the above points previously mentioned in the B1 and B2 levels and basically
      you are just a pro. If you would like to make a flight from, just to say an example, Amsterdam to Utrecht (which is
      legally not allowed) then you would have to have a B3 license.

#### A taste of mountain flying
I went with my current employer to the DockerCon Barcelona 2015. I started working for them since July 2015
and this job ended up something that I had not expected at all, in a good way. Here we do R&D heavily on
distributed computing technologies and on better software delivery processes. This has been a topic of my
interest for a long time and even though I had been on top of the latest releases of new technologies in this
area the best I could do at the time for myself was to keep me updated by reading news articles whenever I
got the time, some other times was I left alone only with time for headlines and with some luck some other times
to try out the technology in question.
It happens that here now I get paid for that, for trying out new things and for prooving its worth. So I basically
I get paid for doing stuff that before I used to do on my free time. I adore my job and I don't want to lose it
so I started working pretty hard to demonstrate my worth and to learn as much as I could. But I forgot to rest so
by the time that we got to the DockerCon Barcelona 2015 (which the company paid for) I was already exhausted. Like
really exhausted. Just the week before I had had a small nervous breakdown. Nothing too serious but indeed
disturbing. So I decided to take a couple of days off right after the conference and then the next week
just telecommute from Barcelona. Talking to my boss we decide that the best is that I take the next week off
as well. So I am now in Spain with all these days off and I don't really now what to do. I know that I need to
take some rest for my own sake so I guess I'm just going to chill in the city until I have to come back. Or perhaps...
Lightbulb moment: I can just find a hang gliding school in Spain and take some mountain flying lessons here. Yeah, boy!
It took me about an hour or two to find a school, explain my situation (that I had some experience flying already
but had never launched from the mountain and that I didn't know how to flare). I also sent them a couple of videos
that some fellow pilots recorded of me here in The Netherlands. The instructor is somewhat convinced and suggests
that I go to the training hill for a day or so to assess my skills, see if I have some sort of bad habit or whatever.
So we agreed that I'd get there on Wednesday and stay for a good week hoping to do some good progress.
But I was too eager. I was really excited about this. So I decided to just leave on Tuesday. Fuck it. I'll just go.
Google Maps told me I should be there (Àger, Spain) in about three hours taking the train and the bus. Took me 8
hours. I took the wrong train. Or well, not exactly the wrong train but the one that stopped on every single town
along the way, which made things more entertaining because that was just going to delay everything, making me
arrive to the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night with nowhere specifically where to stay on a winter night.
Adventure time!
I arrive to the small village. The streets are silent. I ask some local on how to find the address of the hostel. Easy.
Instructions even given in Catalá.
I found the hostel but nobody was there. I was calling the instructor on his phone but he would not answer. It was already
somewhere around 21:30 and I was hungry from the long trip and also cold because winter in the night. I hear in the distance
(but can't see because there was a dense fog that night) some (drunk?) people playing guitar and singing along and also a
light banner of some sort of bar. I decide to go there and see what they have to offer for food and perhaps they know
a safe place where I can sleep that night. But first things first. Food first.  
After I'm done with my meal I overhear a conversation of some people talking about flying or something... I think these
guys must be either paragliders or perhaps related to the school that I had been in touch with. So I approach them, asking
if they are hang gliding pilots right away and they say yes. Ah, found them! The instructor gives me an impressed look, asking
if I was the person earlier calling his phone. He says that this takes him by surprise as I am supposed to arrive not until
the next day.  
Good people. We end up in the street and they start again playing the guitar and singing. This is fun already!

Next day, then, off we go to the mountain to see the other pilots take off. They try to fix the logistics so that I can go to
the training hill in the morning and perhaps hit the high mountain (1000m height!). But it was just not meant to be. The plans
were already arranged and there was no way to squeeze me in there so I had to be happy with just going up and see
everybody take off. I enjoyed it. I really like seeing the pilots rigging up their wings, getting ready for the flight,
taking off and seeing them fly into the distance. It's a very joyful experience.

In the afternoon we came back so that the pilots could have a second go at it and the instructor decided to take me on a tandem
flight. Whoop. We got ready in no time, put the wing together, made a test run, did the hang check and off we went!
It was fun but to be honest I didn't like it as much. I mean, it's flying and it's enjoyable and the view was also pretty good
but apparently I had to take one of those flights to realise that tandems are not my thing. I totally missed the
process of assessing the situation on my own, making the decision to take of, control the wing in the air, make the corrections
and all that. The experience felt a little crippled. Don't get me wrong: I liked it, but let's say that I prefer
to fly on my own.

#### The training hill
So we went the next morning to the training hill. Some warming up and there I was with the school wing showing my skills
demonstrating that I was a good student. The instructor corrected a habit apparently learned by flying on the winch
which was to not let the wing fly earlier. He also taught me how to flare. So far I had ran four races and performed good.
Then the instructor told me: ok, one more. If you do good I take you up to the mountain so don't screw it up!
Haha, no pressure.

#### Going up the mountain
I did good and we packed up and drove up. Me and the rest of the pilots rigged up, got ready and in line,
waiting for the wind to get better because at that moment we had a small yet annoying tail wind that wouldn't allow us to
take off. So we waited. And waited. And waited a little more. Then a little more and then it stroke us all when the
instructor said that the wind was not going to change anymore that day and that we had to pack up and go home.  
Yep. Just like that. All the build up from the day had to go to the toilet because the wind wasn't good anymore.
You could see the disappointment faces on the other pilots as well and the trip to the town was in total silence.
No singing. No laughing. Haha. It was pretty harsh. But we came back and right after a few minutes in the bar
talking about life and how good it is when one flies the spirits were lifted shortly after.

For the rest of the week the instructor was not going to be available and also there were strong winds coming
from the north, which meant that I was not going to be able to fly anymore for the rest of that week and the coming
one, which meant that that was it for my hang gliding adventure in Spain, not without the promise of coming back in February
to finish my mountain training.

#### A word about safety
I am afraid of heights. Badly. I feel butterflies if I put my head out of a window from a fourth floor and above.
But a hang glider is a very sophisticated device with a lot of aeronautical engineering around it. I mean, the first
model was designed by a spacial engineer at the NASA just so you get an idea on what are the fundaments of these devices.
Also the accident rates are on the high pikes because of pilot error and not so much because of hardware failure if you know
what I mean. You should also know that there is a reserve parachute that you toss out in the air whenever the situation
gets hairy and from what I have seen on Internet and from what I have heard in my meetings with more experienced pilots
these hardware failures happen when pilots are performing acrobatics, putting the whole infrastructure under a certain
level of stress that is just not meant for it.
I, personally, am more interested in chill flying and cross country flying more than in aerobatics and more dangerous stuff.
My adrenaline thirst is satiated right at the moment of the take off. After that, I'm good to go and just relax and enjoy the view.

#### You should also try it out
Hang gliding as a sport is pretty well defined. There is a whole world around the flying equipment, the different flying
techniques, the different types of wing and flying instruments, places where you are and you are not allowed to fly, etc.
But unfortunatelly is a sport that does not get a lot of attention from people, perhaps because people think that this
is something really extreme that only crazy people do or that is super dangerous and you put your life at risk everytime
you launch.
If you have the chance give it a try, be it enlisting yourself to some course or perhaps just taking a tandem flight to
get a close look at what is it like to be able to fly like a bird without engines.


That's all I have to say for now. Hopefully the next time that I write an article related to my hang gliding lessons will
be to tell you that I finally got my B2 license and that I went back to Àger for more mountain lessons.

'Til the next time!
