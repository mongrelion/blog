title = "Microservices infrastructure with Terraform, Consul and Vault"
+++

> Together with Container Solutions and Cisco, we built a robust infrastructure specialised
in the delivery of microservices.
Three key components of this infrastructure were [Terraform] for building the infrastructure,
[Consul] for service discovery and [Vault] for managing secrets.
In this talk I explain the product we built and how it all glues together.
