> While doing my job as a consultant at Container Solutions I quickly learnt
that even though **companies want change**, as in, they want to adopt
agile softwate development methodologies, DevOps, Containers, Orchestrators, etc., **they**
simply **are not ready** for such a pace. From lack of technical know-how to critical
cultural challenges, they ignore what the road up ahead looks like and what they
have to do to embrace these transitions.
In this talk, by making a parallel of the history of the liberation of South America,
I help people from all the instances within a company to see what are these
challenges, what's the best formula for success when driving change in big corporations
and a few other tips so that they don't panic.
