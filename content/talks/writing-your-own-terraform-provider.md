+++

> While working for a customer at Container Solutions I got the opportunity not only to
introduce Terraform to one of their critical infrastructure processes reducing a deliverable
that normally would take 2 weeks into a 30 minutes Terraform run, but also to write two
Terraform providers. In this talk, preceded by a [blog post](https://container-solutions.com/write-terraform-provider-part-1/)
about the same topic, I explain step by step why would you and how could you write your
own Terraform provider.

#### Presented at:

  - HashiCorp User Group Amsterdam, The Netherlands
