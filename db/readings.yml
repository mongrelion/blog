  :opinion: |
    A page turner, indeed. The scenes are pretty well described in my opinion.
    The author is pretty cautious, avoiding adding extra details to the scenes
    that most of the times make the reading stressing and boring.
    The story is told as if the reader had direct access to the protagonists'
    journals.
