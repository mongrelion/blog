Haven't you noticed that just after news about Facebook [acquiring][1]
[WhatsApp][2] were released, the platform [went down][3]?
Reminds me of [Telegram][4], a messaging platform that got a US$200k+ investment
from the Russia's Mark Zuckerberg, [Pavel Durov][5].
It was [announced last year (October 2013)][6] and was trying to make some noise
and looking forward to discover possible security issues in the platform with its
**US$200,000** [crypto contest][7]. [Somebody found a bug][8] that was not related with
the contest and [was offered US$100k][9].

Makes me wonder if all the Whatsapp's downtime yesterday were some kind of manipulation
controlled by the people behind Telegram and WhatsApp, to make people
migrate to the new platform as soon as possible. I say this because with the recent
downtime from WhatsApp I saw a lot of people making much more noise about Telegram.

And I'm not surprised by this, because not only because WhatsApp was down but
also because of the accusations to the NSA spying on people and the Telegram being
super secure with conversation encryption and what not.
